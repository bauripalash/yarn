# Privacy Policy for {{ .InstanceName }}

This is aimed to be the world's simplest privacy policy.
This document should explain to you why the app collects some
information, what happens when your account is deleted and some other
frequently asked questions answered regarding your privacy.

[Yarn.social repository](https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/yarn)
and answers will be honest and quickly as possible.

## What identifiable information is stored about me?

Your username along with your user information such as optional Avatar and Tagline.
Your email address is used for password recovery only and is **NOT** stored,
only a hash of it is stored and used for comparison when you user the password
recovery feature.

## How is this all free? There must be a catch!

Absolutely no catch. This project is just a way of giving back to the community
that I've learned so much from. If you'd like to show your appreciation however,
you can follow me on my social media and let me know how much it helped you, or
donate to help pay the cloud bills, or if you are a fellow developer, you can
head to the [Yarn.social repository](https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/yarn) and
contribute to the code by raising a PR.
