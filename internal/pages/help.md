# Help

## Why do I need an account?

You need to have an account so this Yarn.social pod can uniquely identity you
in a meaningful way and create a personalized timeline based on users
and feeds you follow as well as allow you to post Twts against your own
user or create feeds to post as different topics of interested or personas.

Without creating an account you are limited to reading the pod's local
user timeline of feeds (_basically all the posts of the users on that pod_)
but you are unable to participate. You _may_ also be able to view the
profiles of any user on that pod **provided** the pod operator has chosen to
and configured "open profiles". You are also able to follow a user without an
account by subscribing to their Atom feed. You can also similarly subscribe to
the pod's local timeline of users feeds.

## How to create an account?

To create an account on {{ .InstanceName }} simply navigate to
[/register](/register) assuming the operator of this
instance has left user registration open. There you need to fill
in a valid Username and Password and optional Email Address
(_which is only used for password recovery_).

## How do follow someone?

Following someone in the twtxt community is actually rather hard to do
because of it being decentralised. This means no one company or entity
controls who posts what, where, why or how on their twtxt feeds.


Nevertheless following someone on the same instance ({{ .InstanceName }})
you are on is easy! Simply [/login](/login) and navigate to the
[/discover](/discover) page to find _public_ posts of
users on the same instance. This is a good way to discover new users.

## How do I format my posts?

The software that powers this pod {{ .InstanceName }} ([a Yarn.social pod](https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/yarn))
supports what's called [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).
(_It actually supports the full syntax of Markdown really but it is not recommended as twtxt posts are limited to single lines and length_)

This means you can format your posts in very simple but powerful ways:

- Anything that looks like a link is automatically rendered as a click-able link
- Use `**bold**` or `__italics__` to place emphasis on your parts of your post
- Use `fixed width` to render text in fixed-width or another style of emphasis
- Use `[Title](url)` to give your links a nice pretty title
- Use `![](url)` to link to external images which will be rendered inline with your post

Of course twtxt is fully Unicode and Emoji capable so any Emoji you
can type on your keyboard (_such as the special keyboard on your iPhone_)
will also work nicely.

> **Pro Tip:** Just use the "Formatting Toolbar".
