## Installation

### Pre-built Binaries

As a first point, please try to use one of the pre-built binaries that are
available on the [Releases](https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/yarn/releases) page.

### Using Homebrew

We provide [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) formulae for macOS users for both the
command-line client (`yarnc`) as well as the server (`yarnd`).

```console
brew tap yarnsocial/yarn https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/homebrew-yarn.git
brew install yarn
```

Run the server:

```console
yarnd
```

Run the command-line client:

```console
yarnc
```

### Building from source

This is an option if you are familiar with [Go](https://golang.org) development.

1. Clone this repository (_this is important_)

```console
git clone https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/yarn.git
```

2. Install required dependencies (_this is important_)

Linux, macOS:

```console
make deps
```
Note that in order to get the media upload functions to work, you need to
install ffmpeg and its associated `-dev` packages. Consult your distribution's package
repository for availability and names.

FreeBSD:

- Install `gmake`
- Install `pkgconf` that brings `pkg-config`

```console
gmake deps
```

3. Build the binaries

Linux, macOS:

```console
make
```

FreeBSD:

```console
gmake
```


## Usage

### Command-line Client

1. Login to  your [Yarn.social](https://yarn.social) pod:

```#!console
$ ./yarnc login
INFO[0000] Using config file: /Users/prologic/.twt.yaml
Username:
```

2. Viewing your timeline

```#!console
$ ./yarnc timeline
INFO[0000] Using config file: /Users/prologic/.twt.yaml
> prologic (50 minutes ago)
Hey @rosaelefanten 👋 Nice to see you have a Twtxt feed! Saw your [Tweet](https://twitter.com/koehr_in/status/1326914925348982784?s=20) (_or at least I assume it was yours?_). Never heard of `aria2c` till now! 🤣 TIL

```

3. Making a Twt (_post_):

```#!console
$ ./yarnc post
INFO[0000] Using config file: /Users/prologic/.twt.yaml
Testing `yarn` the command-line client
INFO[0015] posting twt...
INFO[0016] post successful
```

For additional help on using the `yarnc` command-line client:

```#!console
$ yarnc help
This is the command-line client for Yarn.social pods running
yarnd. This tool allows a user to interact with a pod to view their timeline,
following feeds, make posts and managing their account.

Usage:
  yarnc [command]

Available Commands:
  completion  generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell
  help        Help about any command
  login       Login and authenticate to a Yarn.social pod
  post        Post a new twt to a Yarn.social pod
  stats       Parses and performs statistical analytis on a Twtxt feed given a URL or local file
  timeline    Display your timeline

Flags:
  -c, --config string   set a custom config file (default "/Users/prologic/.yarnc.yml")
  -D, --debug           Enable debug logging
  -h, --help            help for yarnc
  -t, --token string    yarnd API token to use to authenticate to endpoints (default "$YARNC_TOKEN")
  -U, --uri string      yarnd API endpoint URI to connect to (default "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/")

Use "yarnc [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```
### Deploy With Docker Swarm and Cloudflare

Visit: [deployment](./deployment/)

### Deploy with Docker Compose

Run the compose configuration:

```console
docker-compose up -d
```

Then visit: http://localhost:8000/

### Web App

Run yarnd:

```console
yarnd -R
```

__NOTE:__ Registrations are disabled by default so hence the `-R` flag above.

Then visit: http://localhost:8000/

You can configure other options by specifying them on the command-line or via environment variables.

To view the available options simply run:

```console
$ ./yarnd --help
```

Valid environment value names are the long-option version of a flag in all uppercase with dashes repalced by an underscore `_`.

## Configuring your Pod

At a bare minimum you should set the following options:

- `-d /path/to/data`
- `-s bitcask:///path/to/data/twtxt.db` (_we will likely simplify/default this_)
- `-n <name>` to give your pod a unique name.
- `-u <url>` the base url (_public facing_) of how your pod will be reahced on the web.
- `-R` to enable open registrations.
- `-O` to enable open profiles.

Most other configuration values _should_ be done via environment variables.

It is _recommended_ you pick an account you want to use to "administer" the
pod with and set the following environment values:

- `ADMIN_USER=username`
- `ADMIN_EMAIL=email`

In order to configure email settings for password recovery and the `/support`
and `/abuse` endpoints, you should set appropriate `SMTP_` values.

It is **highly** recommended you also set the following values to secure your Pod:

- `API_SIGNING_KEY`
- `COOKIE_SECRET`
- `MAGICLINK_SECRET`

These values _should_ be generated with a secure random number generator and
be of length `64` characters long. You can use the following shell snippet
to generate secrets for your pod for the above values:

```console
$ cat /dev/urandom | tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9' | fold -w 64 | head -n 1
```

There is a shell script in `./tools/gen-secrets.sh` you can use to conveniently generate the required secrets for a production pod. The output is designed to by copy/pasted into a `docker-compose.yml` file with the right indentation.

**DO NOT** publish or share these values. **BE SURE** to only set them as env vars.

__NOTE:__ The [Dockerfile](/Dockerfile) specifies that the container run as
          the user `yarnd` with `uid=1000`. Be sure that any volume(s) you
          mount into your container and use as the data storage (`-d/--data`)
          path and database storage path (`-s/--store`) is correctly configured
          to have the correct user/group ownership. e.g: `chorn -R 1000:1000 /data`

## Production Deployments

### Docker Swarm

You can deploy `yarnd` to a [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/)
cluster by utilising the provided `yarn.yaml` Docker Stack. This also depends on
and uses the [Traefik](https://docs.traefik.io/) ingress load balancer so you must
also have that configured and running in your cluster appropriately.

```console
docker stack deploy -c yarn.yml
```
